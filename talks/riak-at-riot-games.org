- Data model challenges (14:25 - 25:00)
  - Complex queries - 2i
  - Conflict resolution
    - Redundant results for processing same data multiple time - LWW
    - Append-only data, like logs - set union of entries
    - aggregate stats, sets of counters - no way to resolve conflicts as is.
      - Solution 1: send deltas and performs set union, downside is it is
        expensive
      - Solution 2: truncate deltas per interval (still can conflict after an
        extended netsplit). Overall, loosing writes is OK for stats.
- Single, physical, data center on US West Coast, so no replication experience
- K/V only! 2i and MR are expansive and not recommended
- Riak > Cassandra because it gives you a choice of how to resolve conflicts,
  whereas Cassandra is LWW-only (31:26 - 31:42)
- Data stored as binary, not JSON (31:50 - 32:10)
- They use LevelDB backend
- Total stored data size: 45 TB, compressed
- Both, legacy MySQL and new Riak are still in use (33:15 - 33:40)
