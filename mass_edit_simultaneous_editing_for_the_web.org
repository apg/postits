* Andrew's Notes
- We often need to make changes to lots of structurally similar text,
  but it's tedious
- Simultaneous editing (e.g. multiple cursors) can help here.
  - SE uses records (maybe lines, paragraphs, a specific pattern)
  - Very effective in homogeneous editing
- Mass Edit uses a technique based on clustering
- Related Work
  - PBD (programming by demonstration). The user does a bunch of
    edits, the system creates a program out of it to be applied
    - TELS, Eager, DEED, and SmartEDIT
  - Visual Awk
  - They have previously used clustering for find and replace:

  I've omitted notes on these sections)

- Algorithm
  1. Extract structure into runs:
     - Ex: "UBD_NAME--55" is converted into the structural sequence
           alphanumerics, punctuation, alphanumerics, punctuation, punctuation,
           digits.
  2. The lines are then clustered using Edit Distance between their
     structural sequences as the distance metric
     - Generated greedily using an arbitrary line as the seed
     - Rank lines by edit distance
     - Take clusters where significant gaps occur
       - Considered significant if it exceeds the average gap in a
         window by more than a threshold
     - Before the gap belong with seed, then recurse
  3. Cursor position generalized =(segment, character)=
     - Negative indexes on character are from the right (as in python)
     - The character offset that produces the smallest change is used,
       seeking a "minimum description"
     - Ex: Tom|as Poggio    => cursor position = (0, -2)
           Would result in a cursor for "Patrick Winston" like so:
           Patri|ck Winston

- Discussion
  - The automatic clustering sometimes produces more clusters than
    needed, especially if a user is only looking to edit, say the end
    of a line
